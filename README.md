## Description

This application allows the user to generate a scheme of colors based on an initial color seed of choice and a scheme mode. Once the user choices are completed and the 'Get color scheme' button is clicked, the application will perform a fetch request to The Color API and retrieve a collection of 5 colors. Once the color scheme is generated, the user will be able to copy each color's hexadecimal code to the clipboard by clicking on the color strip or the hexadecimal code displayed at the bottom.
