## Description

This application allows the user to play a simple BlackJack game. The application will display the initial draw cards and ask the user if a new card is desired depending on the sum of the values of the cards. Currently, a static user named 'Andres' with $500 chips is hard-coded. Functionality for adding a new user and recording high-scores with dynamic chips could be added.


## Installation

If the initial draw sum total is less than 21, you will be asked if you want to draw a new card. Once the sum is higher than 21, the game will end.
